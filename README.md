# package
A C++ program that simulates a package delivery service

This program uses OOP to simulate two package delivery options, Two Day shipping and Overnight. A test file shows the difference in price
when selecting between these two options as well as a difference in package weight. Recipient's name, address and total shipping
cost is displayed as a result.
